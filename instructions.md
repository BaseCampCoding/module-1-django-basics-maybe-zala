# Module 1: Installation and Project Creation

## Assignment
Create three independent Django projects at the specified directories, run the development server for each, and verify you can visit the app in a browser.

Directories to create (one project per directory)
1. ~/projects/yet-another-pokedex
2. ~/projects/facebook-clone
3. ~/projects/fake-movie-database

What you must do (for each project)
1. Create the project directory and a Python virtual environment.
2. Activate the virtual environment and install Django.
3. Start a new Django project with the provided name in that directory.
4. Apply initial migrations and run the development server.
5. Open the site in a browser (http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default) to confirm it loads.

## What to turn in
- A Git repository (or three repositories) containing each project folder, or a single repo containing the three project folders.
- A README.md (in the repo root or each project) listing the exact commands you ran.
- Proof that each server was started and the site was visited: either
  - a screenshot for each project showing the running site (or the Django welcome page), or
  - a short screen-recording or GIF, or
  - a link to a public repository with commit(s) demonstrating the project creation and run commands in the README.

## Checklist
- [ ] Project folder present at ~/projects/yet-another-pokedex
- [ ] Project folder present at ~/projects/facebook-clone
- [ ] Project folder present at ~/projects/fake-movie-database
- [ ] Virtual environment created and activated for each
- [ ] `python manage.py migrate` ran without errors
- [ ] `python manage.py runserver` started and site visited (screenshots or recording attached)
- [ ] README with commands and proof of run included in repo

## Mastery Check (Benchmark)

You will be asked to create and run a django project in a directory chosen by your instructor.
